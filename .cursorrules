# Slidev Presentation Optimization Rules

## Font Size and Content Density
- Use `text-sm` class for content-heavy slides to improve readability
- Apply smaller fonts to slides with:
  - Multiple tables
  - Long code blocks
  - Detailed technical specifications
  - Parameter lists
  - Comparison data

## Table and Code Block Management
- **Avoid stacking multiple tables vertically** on the same slide
- **Split slides** when you have:
  - Tables followed by paragraphs or additional content
  - Large code blocks followed by explanations
  - Multiple related but distinct data structures
- Use compact bullet-point formats instead of tables when possible
- Convert table data to inline summaries when space is limited

## Slide Content Organization
- **One main concept per slide** - avoid cramming multiple topics
- **Split content-heavy slides** into focused, single-purpose slides
- Move paragraphs that come after tables/code blocks to the next slide
- Move large lists or blocks of information to separate slides

## Two-Column Layout Optimization
- Use `::right::` directive properly in two-column layouts
- Ensure both columns have consistent formatting
- Apply `text-sm` to both columns for content-heavy slides
- Balance content between left and right columns

## Code Block Best Practices
- Keep code blocks focused and concise
- Split slides when code blocks are followed by additional content
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Include brief explanations before or after code blocks

## Table Optimization
- Convert multi-column tables to bullet points when possible
- Use inline summaries for simple comparisons
- Split complex tables across multiple slides
- Focus on key metrics rather than exhaustive data

## Slide Flow and Readability
- Maintain consistent formatting across similar slide types
- Use clear, descriptive slide titles
- Group related information logically
- Ensure each slide has a clear purpose and message

## Memory and Performance Considerations
- Keep slides focused to prevent vertical overflow
- Use appropriate font sizes for different content types
- Balance information density with readability
- Test presentation flow and timing

## Content Hierarchy
- Use consistent heading levels (###, ####)
- Apply appropriate emphasis (bold, italic) sparingly
- Maintain visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Use bullet points and numbered lists effectively

## Technical Content Presentation
- Split technical details from advantages/limitations
- Separate parameter tables from explanatory content
- Use code blocks for implementation details
- Provide context before showing technical specifications

## Slidev-Specific Rules
- Fix Vue template syntax errors (proper `::right::` usage)
- Use appropriate Slidev layouts (center, two-cols, etc.)
- Apply consistent class names for styling
- Ensure proper markdown table syntax
