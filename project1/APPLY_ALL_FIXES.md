# Apply All Fixes - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Three Critical Fixes to Apply

You need to apply these fixes to make your notebook work properly:

1. **Fix identical results** (all models showing 56.43%)
2. **Fix BERT memory issue** (exceeds 10GB RAM)
3. **Balance regularization** (allow learning while preventing overfitting)

---

## ✅ Fix #1: Model Architecture (Cell 16)

### Problem: Models too small and restricted (16 dims, dropout 0.6)
### Solution: Increase capacity with balanced regularization

**Find Cell 16** and replace the function parameters:

**Change FROM**:
```python
embedding_dim=16, hidden_dim=16, dropout=0.6
```

**Change TO**:
```python
embedding_dim=64, hidden_dim=64, dropout=0.3
```

**Apply to all THREE model classes** (RNN, LSTM, Transformer):

```python
def create_tiny_models(vocab_size):
    """Create small models with BALANCED regularization."""
    
    # RNN Model
    class TinyRNNModel(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim=64, hidden_dim=64, dropout=0.3):  # CHANGED
            # ... rest of code stays same
    
    # LSTM Model
    class TinyLSTMModel(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim=64, hidden_dim=64, dropout=0.3):  # CHANGED
            # ... rest of code stays same
    
    # Transformer Model
    class TinyTransformerModel(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim=64, hidden_dim=128, num_heads=4, num_layers=2, dropout=0.3):  # CHANGED
            # ... rest of code stays same
```

## ✅ Fix #2: Training Parameters (Cell 17)

### Problem: Training too restrictive (lr too low, weight decay too high)
### Solution: Balance the hyperparameters

**Find Cell 17**, locate the training setup section:

**Change FROM**:
```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005, weight_decay=1e-2)
```

**Change TO**:
```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.05)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4)
```

---

## ✅ Fix #3: BERT Memory Issue (Cells 7 and 13)

### Problem: BERT-base uses 4-6GB RAM, exceeds 10GB limit
### Solution: Use DistilBERT (40% smaller, 97% performance)

### **3A: Cell 7 - Reduce Batch Size**

**Find Cell 7**, locate the DataLoader creation:

**Change FROM**:
```python
batch_size = 16
train_loader_bert = DataLoader(train_dataset_bert, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
val_loader_bert = DataLoader(val_dataset_bert, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)
test_loader_bert = DataLoader(test_dataset_bert, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)
```

**Change TO**:
```python
batch_size = 16  # For RNN/LSTM/Transformer
bert_batch_size = 8  # Smaller for BERT to save memory

train_loader_bert = DataLoader(train_dataset_bert, batch_size=bert_batch_size, shuffle=True)
val_loader_bert = DataLoader(val_dataset_bert, batch_size=bert_batch_size, shuffle=False)
test_loader_bert = DataLoader(test_dataset_bert, batch_size=bert_batch_size, shuffle=False)
```

### **3B: Cell 13 - Use DistilBERT**

**Find Cell 13**, locate the BERT instantiation:

**Change FROM**:
```python
bert_model = BERTModel().to(device)
```

**Change TO**:
```python
# Use DistilBERT - 40% smaller, fits in 10GB RAM
bert_model = BERTModel(
    model_name='distilbert-base-uncased',  # Changed from bert-base
    freeze_bert=True,                       # Freeze to save memory
    hidden_dim=128,                         # Smaller classifier
    dropout=0.3
).to(device)
```

### **3C: Cell 24 - Update BERT Training (Optional)**

**Find Cell 24**, update the training call:

**Change FROM**:
```python
model_name="BERT"
```

**Change TO**:
```python
model_name="DistilBERT"
```

## 📋 Quick Reference Card

| Cell | What to Change | From → To |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Cell 16** | embedding_dim | 16 → 64 |
| **Cell 16** | hidden_dim | 16 → 64 (RNN/LSTM), 32 → 128 (Transformer) |
| **Cell 16** | dropout | 0.6 → 0.3 |
| **Cell 16** | num_layers (Transformer) | 1 → 2 |
| **Cell 17** | label_smoothing | 0.1 → 0.05 |
| **Cell 17** | learning_rate | 0.0005 → 0.001 |
| **Cell 17** | weight_decay | 1e-2 → 1e-4 |
| **Cell 7** | batch_size (BERT) | 16 → 8 |
| **Cell 13** | model_name | bert-base → distilbert-base |
| **Cell 13** | freeze_bert | - → True |

## 🔄 Execution Order

After making changes:

1. **Restart kernel** (Kernel → Restart Kernel)
2. **Run Cells 1-8** (data loading and preprocessing)
3. **Run Cell 16** (new balanced models)
4. **Run Cell 17** (new training function)
5. **Run Cell 18** (train all models)
6. **Check results** - should be DIFFERENT and better!

## 📊 Expected Results After Fixes

### Before (Current - Wrong)
```
❌ RNN:        56.43% accuracy
❌ LSTM:       56.43% accuracy (identical!)
❌ Transformer: 56.43% accuracy (identical!)
❌ BERT:       OUT OF MEMORY error
```

### After (Fixed - Correct)
```
✅ RNN:        65-75% accuracy
✅ LSTM:       70-80% accuracy (better than RNN!)
✅ Transformer: 75-85% accuracy (best custom model!)
✅ DistilBERT: 80-88% accuracy (best overall, uses ~3GB)
```

**Key**: Models should be **DIFFERENT**, not identical!

---

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue: "Still getting identical results"
**Solution**: Make sure you changed ALL THREE models in Cell 16, not just one

### Issue: "Still running out of memory with DistilBERT"
**Solution**: 
1. Check batch_size is 8 for BERT loaders
2. Ensure `freeze_bert=True` 
3. Try hidden_dim=64 instead of 128
4. As last resort, skip BERT (it's optional for comparison)

### Issue: "Models training too slowly"
**Solution**: This is normal with CPU. GPU would be 10-50x faster

### Issue: "Train accuracy too high again (>95%)"
**Solution**: Models might be overfitting. Increase dropout to 0.4 or reduce hidden_dim to 48

## 💡 Understanding the Balance

```
Too Restrictive (Current) → Models can't learn → All identical (56%)
                              ↓
                          FIX APPLIED
                              ↓
Balanced (Target) → Models learn well → Different results (65-85%)
```

**Goal**: Find the sweet spot where models:
1. Learn meaningful patterns (train 75-85%)
2. Generalize well (val 70-80%)
3. Show reasonable gap (< 15%)
4. Perform differently based on architecture
