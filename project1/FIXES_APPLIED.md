# Comprehensive Fixes Applied to Sentiment Analysis Project

## Date: October 17, 2025

This document summarizes all fixes applied to address overfitting, data overlap, and runtime errors in the sentiment analysis notebook.

---

## 1. Data Overlap Fix ✅

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: 3 samples appeared in multiple splits (train/val/test)
- **Root Cause**: Text preprocessing converted different original texts to identical cleaned texts
- **Impact**: Data leakage, artificially inflated validation performance

### Solution Implemented (Cell 4)
```python
# Remove overlapping samples from validation and test sets
# Keep training set intact to preserve maximum training data
# Result: 0 overlaps, clean data separation
```

**Results**:
- Before: 2000 train, 500 val, 500 test (3 overlaps)
- After: 2000 train, 499 val, 498 test (0 overlaps)

---

## 2. Empty Text Filter ✅

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Some texts became empty after aggressive preprocessing
- **Error**: `RuntimeError: Length of all samples has to be greater than 0`
- **Root Cause**: Stopword removal + cleaning left some texts completely empty

### Solution Implemented (Cell 4)
```python
def filter_empty_texts(texts, labels):
    """Remove texts that became empty after preprocessing."""
    filtered_texts = []
    filtered_labels = []
    for text, label in zip(texts, labels):
        if text.strip():  # Only keep non-empty texts
            filtered_texts.append(text)
            filtered_labels.append(label)
    return filtered_texts, filtered_labels
```

**Results**:
- Prevents pack_padded_sequence errors
- Ensures all samples have content
- Clean dataset ready for training

## 3. RNN/LSTM Forward Pass Fix ✅

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: `pack_padded_sequence` failed with zero-length sequences
- **Error**: `RuntimeError: Length of all samples has to be greater than 0`
- **Complexity**: Packing/unpacking added unnecessary complexity

### Solution Implemented (Cells 11, 12)
```python
# Simplified forward pass without packing
# Added bounds checking and clamping
lengths = attention_mask.sum(dim=1).clamp(min=1) - 1
lengths = lengths.clamp(max=rnn_output.size(1) - 1)
last_outputs = rnn_output[torch.arange(batch_size, device=input_ids.device), lengths]
```

**Benefits**:
- Removed complex pack_padded_sequence logic
- Added safety checks for edge cases
- Fixed device mismatch issues
- More stable and easier to debug

---

## 4. Overfitting Prevention ✅

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Models achieved 100% train AND 100% validation accuracy
- **Root Cause**: Models memorizing training data, not learning patterns
- **Impact**: No generalization to unseen data

### Solutions Implemented

#### A. Model Architecture (Cells 11, 12, 14, 16)
**Before**:
- 128-256 dimensional embeddings
- 2-3 layers
- Bidirectional
- Millions of parameters

**After**:
- 16-32 dimensional embeddings
- Single layer
- Unidirectional
- ~80K-180K parameters

#### B. Strong Regularization
**Dropout (0.6)**: Multiple layers
```python
self.dropout_emb = nn.Dropout(0.6)  # After embedding
self.dropout_rnn = nn.Dropout(0.6)  # After RNN/LSTM
self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Dropout(0.6),  # Before classifier
    nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 2)
)
```

**Label Smoothing (0.1)**:
```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(label_smoothing=0.1)
```

**Weight Decay (1e-2)**:
```python
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0005, weight_decay=1e-2)
```

**Gradient Clipping (1.0)**:
```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```

#### C. Training Strategy (Cells 17, 20, 22, 23, 25)
**Lower Learning Rate**: 0.0005 (was 0.001)

**Aggressive Early Stopping**:
- Patience: 3 epochs (was 5)
- Based on validation loss (not accuracy)
- Stop if train-val gap > 20%

**Learning Rate Scheduling**:
```python
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer, mode='min', patience=2, factor=0.5
)
```

#### D. Overfitting Monitoring
Real-time warnings during training:
```python
overfitting_gap = train_acc - val_acc
if train_acc > 85 and overfitting_gap > 10:
    print("⚠️ STRONG OVERFITTING DETECTED!")
```
